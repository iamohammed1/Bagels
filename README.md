# Bagels
Bagels is a number-guessing game where you try to guess a secret three-digit number. After each guess, you receive clues: "Pico" means a correct digit in the wrong place, "Fermi" means a correct digit in the right place, and "Bagels" means no correct digits. The goal is to guess the number within a limited number of attempts.
